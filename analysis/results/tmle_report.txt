TMLE (Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation) Results
======================================================================

Method: Doubly Robust Estimator with Targeting
  - Initial outcome models: μ₁(X), μ₀(X)
  - Propensity score: g(X) = P(T=1|X)
  - Targeting: Clever covariate + fluctuation
  - Estimator: TMLE combines both with bias reduction

Results:
  ATE: -0.066566
  SE: 0.006233
  95% CI: [-0.078784, -0.054349]
  t-statistic: -10.6792
  p-value: 0.000000

  → Statistically significant (p < 0.05)

Interpretation:
  Digital adoption → TFP change: -6.44%

Multiple Imputation:
  M = 10 imputations
  Combined using Rubin's rules
  Degrees of freedom: 1515293411530006.75

Comparison with AIPW:
  TMLE is theoretically more efficient than AIPW
  Both are doubly robust estimators
  TMLE uses targeting to reduce bias further
